Notes App

## 📝 Project Description

This is a simple command-line Notes App developed in Java. The application allows users to write notes and save them to a local file, and also to read and display all previously saved notes. This project was created to demonstrate fundamental concepts of Java File I/O for data persistence.

## ✨ Features

-   *Write Notes:* Users can input text notes, which are then appended to a file named notes.txt.
-   *Read Notes:* The application can read and display all notes from the notes.txt file, with each note on a new line.
-   *Menu-Driven Interface:* A simple command-line interface guides the user with clear options (write, read, exit).

## 🛠 Technology Used

-   *Language:* Java
-   *File I/O:* FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader
-   *IDE:* Visual Studio Code (or any other Java-compatible IDE)

🎓 Outcome and learning

This project served as a great exercise in learning:
-   How to perform basic file operations (read and write) in Java.
-   The importance of exception handling for I/O operations.
-   Best practices for resource management using try-with-resources.
